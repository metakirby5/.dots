.dots
=====

All of my dotfiles, managed with GNU Stow.

![dtop](_misc/dtop.png)

- Folders prefixed with `_` should not be stowed.
  - `_misc` contains configuration that must be manually applied.
  - `_setup` contains setup scripts.
- All other folders can be stowed.
  - Each stowed folder should self-indicate that it is stowed via presence of
    a file with the package's name in `.local/stowed`. For example, the `osx`
    package has the file `.local/stowed/osx`. This allows the `restow-dots`
    script to work.
  - To prevent unexpected behavior, you should use the `--no-folding` flag
    with stow.

Here's what you'll need...

## Installation

### All platforms

- Clone this repo into `~/.dots`.
- Add `source ~/.config/bash/linker.bash` to the appropriate files
  (`~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile`)
- Follow platform-specific instructions.
- Install [`mpx`](https://github.com/metakirby5/mpx).
- Install packages with `mpx <PACKABGE_MANAGER>:install-leaves`.
- Install browser extensions/themes.
- If you want, copy over `_misc/shell/root_bashrc.sh` to your root's
  home directory (to the appropriate file) and symlink the `.vimrc`.
- Reboot.

### OS X

- Install Xcode from the App Store.
- Import the `Terminal.app` profile in `_misc/osx/Japanesque.terminal`.
- Install `brew` from [brew.sh](http://brew.sh/).
- Write `/opt/homebrew/bin` to `/etc/paths.d/brew`.
- Install `stow` and `bash` using `brew`.
- Set your shell to `brew`'s `bash` using
  `chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/bash`.
- `cd ~/.dots`
- `stow base osx --no-folding`
- Restart your terminal.
- Install `zenbu` via `pip` and use it to choose a colorscheme with `zenbu -e`.
- `yes | osx-set-defaults`
- Tweak whatever other settings you want in Preferences.app.

### Linux

- Install all the dependencies you need with your favorite package
  manager. You really need `stow` and `zenbu`.
- `cd ~/.dots`
- `stow base linux`
- If you are using i3:
  - `stow i3`
  - Ensure you are using `i3init` to start i3.
- `source ~/.bashrc`
- Ensure your profile is called `profile` so the templates in
  `~/.mozilla/firefox/profile` can render properly.
- Use `zenbu` and choose a colorscheme.
- Install *Stylish* for Chrome/Firefox and install the relevant userstyles
  from `~/.local/zenbu/userstyles`.
- Set up oomox and use the file in `~/.local/zenbu/oomox.sh`.

## Maintenance

- Regularly pull and `restow-dots` to keep up-to-date.
- Regularly `mpx :dump-leaves` to export dependencies.

## TODO

- [ ] Fix zenbu files to allow light colorschemes
- [ ] Stick XVimProject/XVim on brew
